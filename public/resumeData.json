    "bio":"Hi there!  My name is Angela, and I am a creative and detail-oriented Front-End Developer. I recently earned a certificate in Full Stack Web Development from the University of Connecticut, where I developed skills in CSS, JavaScript, React.js, and responsive web design. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Business Administration from Texas Tech University, and most recently I worked as a Therapeutic Recreation Director in long-term care. When I’m not coding, I enjoy reading, running, crafting, and spending time with my toddler son, Owen.",
